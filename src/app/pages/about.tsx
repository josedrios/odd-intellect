      <p>
        I am just some young adult who likes to code. I love my friends and
        family, weight training, and consuming pieces of media that completely
        change the way I think. I am also kind of a bum.

      <TextPanel text="WHY THE WEBSITE?" />
      <p>
        When you ask a question to 10 people, you sometimes get 10 different
        responses. When you ask a deep question to everyone on the internet who
        is willing to respond, every answer is unique. That was my attempt of
        trying to say something deep about why I made this website. I guess I
        made this website just to see how people of all walks of life actually
        think. To see how different and similiar everyone is from each other.
