      <p>
        I do not want to run ads on this webiste. If I ever actually deploy this
        website I will most likely pay for the maintenance cost out of my own
        pocket. If you are willing or bored or just want to help a dude out,
        please donate to a mofo <a>here</a>
      </p>
    </>
  );
